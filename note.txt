************************************************************

-> {{}} is called interpolation to print ts file to html
-> function,variable,other js operation like arithmatic can print in interpolation
-> we can not assign the value of variable in interpolation
-> typeof operator is also not work in interpolation
-> increment decrement is also not working.
-> we have add class or name dynamically using typescript in interpolation

---------------------------------------------

-> component is a file which contain specific module which use many times

---------------------------------------------

-> If we do not required style file we can use ng g c name --inline-style
-> It is use for when we not write much more css and most of css comes from global style.css file
-> If we do not required html file we can use ng g c name --inline-template
-> It is use for when we have to use only few tags in file
-> We can use both at a same time using --inline-style --inline-template

---------------------------------------------

-> Module is big functionallity it contains many more services,pipes,components
-> Ex userauth is a module which contain login,signup,forget Password,api call,helpers
-> ng stands for next generation
-> module contain one file
-> ng g m user-auth
-> ng g c user-auth/login
-> When user-auth load then login,signup load in memory
-> at initial stage all component load at run time

---------------------------------------------

-> tsconfig.json -> "strict": true if we set strict:false then we can write javascript
-> ex in function pass we can not required to write string,number etc for any variable
